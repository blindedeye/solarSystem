## Overview
Semester Final Project for Computer Graphics. Goal was to make a vertex and fragment shader to simulate a semi-realistic solar system simulation. 

Project includes all the planets in our solar system (minus planet rings), the sun, and earth's moon. 

Future Improvements:
- Space themed background
- More accurate spacing of planets from sun
- Add planet rings
- Eliptical orbits instead of circular
- Improved camera functionality
